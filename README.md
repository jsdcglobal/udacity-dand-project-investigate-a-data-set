# udacity-dand-project-investigate-a-data-set
For this project Data Analyst Nanodegree students were required to choose one of Udacity's curated datasets, perform an investigation, and share their findings.

# the-data-set
Students were allowed to choose a variety of data sets provided by Kaggle.com. For this project I chose to use the provided IMDb Movie Data found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf).

# project-motivation
This project was a selfed paced project where students are meant to illustrate basic understanding of the general steps of the Data Analysis process after completing coursework in a high level learning module. These steps include 1) Asking Questions, 2) Wrangling Data, 3) Exploring Data, and 4) Drawing Conclusions and are by no means exclusively linear. We may find that iterating over steps 1) - 3) happen many times before drawing final conclusions.

Specifically to this data set, I sought to answer the question _How Do I Make a Popular Movie?_
