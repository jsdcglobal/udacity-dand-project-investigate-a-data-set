    "<p>Considering the year we've had in 2020 the plight of the movie industry looks bleak. Due to Covid-19 many movie theaters in the US were forced to completely shutter operations by April and it is very likely that no new movies will be released in theaters until the summer of 2021. Major film studios like Disney, Universal, Sony, and MGM may be able to bounce back from situations like this, but what about smaller production houses and minor film studios? How will they fair in 2021? What can they do to produce a popular and lucrative movies to help boost their bottom line?</p>\n",
    "<p>What steps can smaller studios take to pad their pockets with as much capital as they'd need to bounce back a success post 2020? Let's take a look at the past to give us some ideas on the following:</p>\n",

    "<p>Right off the bat we can see which columns are going to be of interest in our data set. We're going to want to get a good understanding of <em>popularty</em>, <em>budget</em>, and <em>revenue</em> amongst other things. Some of the columns have more than one value in them, in partciular <em>cast</em> and <em>genre</em>. We may find that we need to split those values up for further analysis. In our original supposition we didn't really note the <em>runtime</em> but now that I see it as an available column we may want to consider doing some analysis that focuses on how <em>runtime</em> affects the net revenue. Speaking of net revenue, there's no column that gives us the amount of profit the movie made; we'll need to calculate this ourselves from the <em>budget</em> and <em>revenue</em> columns. Another thing we didn't think about was competition. We might want to consider breaking up the data in the <em>production_companies</em> column to get an understanding of which of our competitors are the most profitable and around when do they normally release so that we can try to find good windows of time that we can release without a lot of competition. Lastly there are some columns here with values wehre it isn't particularly apparent what they mean. The <em>vote_count</em> and <em>vote_average</em> columns seem like they may be important but what are they? I think first we'll need to do a little internet reserach to determine what these columns even are.</p>"

    "<p>Now that I take a look, is this <em>popularity</em> value actually useless? There appears to be no correlation between popularity of a movie and it's profitability. I didn't really explore these values earlier but when I look back at the standard statistics we got before, it looks like the min value is below 0 and the max value is above 32. The third quartile is at ~ 0.73 which leads me to believe that this <em>popularity</em> column is not a standardized value that means much of anything from row to row. I'm not sure I believe that there is no correlation between how popular a movie is and how profitable it is.</p>\n",
    "<p>Thankfully we still have the <em>vote_average</em> column that we researched before. We know for a fact that this is a standardized rating system and a value of 5 for example is going to mean the same for all rows. Let's try to answer this question with the <em>vote_average</em> value instead.</p>"

    "<p>Looks like most of the movies from 2005 - 2015 were only moderately if at all profitable but the ones that really stuck out as being super profitable had a <em>vote_range</em> between 5 and 7. Based on this the answer to our question is <strong>no; more popular movies actually aren't always more profitable.</strong> On the flip side though, movies that aren't at least moderately popular don't do that great either. For an outstandingly profitable movie it looks like the sweet spot is a user rating somewhere between 5 out of 10 and 7 out of 10. Considering the scatter plot though, it looks like movie likability is indeed <strong>not</strong> a deciding factor on profit. I wonder if comparing the buckets would help us to get more insight?</p>"

    "<p>Doesn't look like there were many blockbusters in our data, but even movies with a user rating as low as 3 were able to break even. Seeing that we have blockbusters among those movies with a user rating of 5 and again of 6 I feel reassured that the bizarre looking scatter plot above wasn't incorrect. It doesn't matter if users loved you or hated you, you can end up in the red just as easily. And above a user rating of 2 you can hope to break even or even produce some movie gold! <strong>Well now we know our small production house doesn't have to make a super popular movie to turn a profit</strong>, but what can we do to help turn a profit?</p>\n",

    "<p>Another bizarre looking scatter plot. Again there appears to be no real correlation between what season a movie is released and how profitable it is, but we do have some outliers in winter and autumn. It looks like spring is going to be the least likely time to make a ton of money probably. Something that is interesting about the scatter plot in relation to the histogram is that it looks like a lot of movies were released in the autumn, but the highest profit outlier was released in the winter - can we infer that making sure we at least release at a time when less releases are available might help to boost the profit a bit?</p>\n",

    "<p>Again we can see that all year round we have an equal opportunity to lose money on a movie we produce and end up in the red.</p>\n",
    "<p>My head is telling me a pie chart of just the autumn values might be interesting to look at but I already know that looking at pie charts isn't going to help me see what's postulating in my mind. Mathematically speaking any category above break even means a profit and 460 movies out of 810 made a profit in the autumn (57%).</p>\n",
    "<p>In the spring that number sinks to 251 out of 604 (42%). \n",
    "<br/>But in the summer we're talking 379 out of 566 (67%).\n",
    "<br/>Then in the winter it's 360 out of 607 (59%).</p>\n",
    "<p>So some quick calculator math confirms what I think I saw in the scatter plot. That the spring wasn't nearly as profitable as the rest of the seasons and that the winter was slightly more profitable than the autumn. I had postulated that our winter outlier was possibly so profitable because it came during a time when less releases were available, and if I look at these percentages, the summer data makes me believe that this is a phenomenon that is indeed of note. The summer looks to be the most profitable out of all of the seasons. We didn't see a gigantic profit movie in the summer like we did in the winter but the winter only had 1 movie that could be considered a blockbuster while the summer has 2. Additionally in the summer only 566 movies were released. Out of the 3 seasons, it has the least number of overall releases. I really am starting to think that if we release during a time when less releases are happening, i.e. when we have less competition, we may be able to net more profit!</p>\n",
    "<p>Now I feel like we're getting somewhere. <strong>We need to release during a time when there are less releases.</strong></p>\n",
    "<p>Let's just dig a little deeper and see if any specific months stand out.</p>"

Well I know how to complete this kind of split in SQL but not so much in pandas so I Google searched, \"how to create a new data frame from an old data frame with specific columns,\" \"how to set the index of a dataframe to the id,\" and \"how to split a column's values\" and this is exactly what we did to get an output with just the actor info. Let's do the same for genres so we can do some comparisons. I'll have to hope to God that there aren't any misspellings or name variations between actors at this point since we haven't particularly learned how to deal with a fuzzy merge in pandas and it's a bit out of scope of the requirements for this project.</p>"
